Goal
------
This blog post should show that natural-gradient descent can be implemented efficiently in some cases.

We will give an informal introduction with a focus on high level of ideas.



# Exponential Family
------

## Minimal Exponential Family


## Efficient Natural-gradient Computation


## Natural-gradient Descent as Unconstrained Mirror Descent


# Handling Parameter Constraints
------

## Using an Adaptive Step-size

## Projected Natural-gradient Descent and (Constrained) Mirror Descent

## Riemannain Gradient Descent


# Natural-gradient Descent for Gaussian Families
------

## Newton-like Update
