# Two kinds of Spaces
------
We will discuss (Riemannian) gradient spaces and parameter spaces for gradient-based updates.

As we disucssed in [Part II]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-10-04-Geomopt02 %}#riemannian-gradients-as-tangent-vectors-optional), the parameter space $\Omega_\tau$ and the tangent space denoted by `$T_{\tau_0}\mathcal{M}$` at point $\tau_0$ are two distinct spaces. 
Given  [intrinsic parametrization]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-09-06-Geomopt01 %}#intrinsic-parameterizations)  `$\tau$`,  the tangent space is a (complete) vector space and `$T_{\tau_0}\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{R}^K$` while the parameter space $\Omega_\tau$ is like a local vector space in `$\mathcal{R}^K$`, where $K$ is the dimension of the manifold. In other words, `$\Omega_\tau$` is often an open (proper) subset of `$\mathcal{R}^K$`.

In manifold cases, we have to explicitly distinguish the difference between the representation of a point (parameter) and a vector (Riemannian gradient).  These two spaces are different in many aspects such as
the domain and the distance.
Mathematically
speaking,  a (Riemannian) gradient space is much simpler and nicer than a  parameter space.

# Natural-gradient Descent in an Intrinsic Parameter Space
------

Using intrinsic parametrization $\tau$, we can perform a natural-gradient update known as natural-gradient descent (NGD) {% cite amari1998natural %} when we use the Fisher-Rao metric.

<div class="notice--success" markdown="1">
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{NGD:} &\,\,\,\,\, 
\tau_{k+1} \leftarrow \tau_{k} - \alpha \hat{\mathbf{g}}_{\tau_k} 
\end{aligned}\tag{1}\label{1}
$$` 
</div>
where `$\hat{\mathbf{g}}_{\tau_k}$` is a natural gradient evaluated at point `$\tau_{k}$` and $\alpha>0$ is a step-size.

This update in Eq. `$\eqref{1}$` is inspired by the standard vector update in the **gradient space**.
By choosing an intrinsic parametrization, this update is also valid in the **parameter space** as long as the step-size is small
enough. 

The update in the parameter space is valid since the parameter space $\Omega_\tau$ has a local vector-space structure thanks to the use of an intrinsic parametrization.
However, when $\Omega_\tau$ is a proper subset of `$T_{\tau_k}\mathcal{M}$` (i.e., `$\Omega_\tau \neq T_{\tau_k}\mathcal{M} $`), the update in Eq. `$\eqref{1}$` is valid only when the step-size $\alpha$ is small enough so that  `$\tau_{k+1} \in \Omega_\tau$`.

<div class="notice--danger" markdown="1">
**Warning**:

Using a small step-size could be an issue since it could greatly slow down the progression of natural-gradient
descent in practice.

# Natural-gradient Descent is Linearly Invariant
------

Recall that in [Part III]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-11-02-Geomopt03 %}#parameter-transformation-and-invariance), we have shown that natural gradients are invariant under any intrinsic parameter transformation.
The parameter transformation can be non-linear.

It is natural to expect that natural-gradient descent has a similar property. Unfortunately, natural-gradient descent is only invariant under an intrinsic **linear** transformation. Note that Newton's method is also linearly invariant while Euclidean gradient descent is not.


Let's consider the following (scalar) optimization problem on a smooth manifold `$\mathcal{M}$` with the Fisher-Rao metric `$F$`.
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{x \in \mathcal{M}} h(x)
\end{aligned}\tag{2}\label{2}
$$` 

Note that `$\mathcal{M}$` in general does not have a vector-space structure. 
We has to **artificially** choose an intrinsic parameterization $\tau$ so that the parameter space $\Omega_\tau$ at least has a local  vector-space structure.
The problem in `$\eqref{2}$` can be re-expressed as below.
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\tau \in \Omega_\tau} h_\tau(\tau)
\end{aligned}
$$` where `$h_\tau$` is the parameter representation of the smooth function `$h$`.

Natural gradient descent in this parameter space `$\Omega_\tau$` is
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{k+1} \leftarrow \tau_{k} - \alpha \hat{\mathbf{g}}_{\tau_k} 
\end{aligned}\tag{3}\label{3}
$$` where  `$\mathbf{F}_\lambda$` is the FIM, natural gradient is `$\hat{\mathbf{g}}_{\tau_k} := [\mathbf{F}_\tau(\tau_k) ]^{-1} \nabla_\tau h_\tau(\tau_k)$` and the step-size `$\alpha$` is small enough so that  `$\tau_{k+1} \in \Omega_\tau$`. 

Consider another intrinsic parameterization $\lambda$ so that `$\lambda=\mathbf{U} \tau$`, where `$\mathbf{U}$` is a constant (square) invertible matrix. 
For simplicity,  we further assume `$\Omega_\lambda=\{ \mathbf{U}\tau |\tau \in\Omega_\tau \} $`, where `$\Omega_\lambda$` is the parameter space of `$\lambda$`. 

Natural gradient descent in this parameter space `$\Omega_\lambda$` is
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\lambda_{k+1} \leftarrow \lambda_{k} -  \alpha  \hat{\mathbf{g}}_{\lambda_k} 
\end{aligned}\tag{4}\label{4}
$$` where `$\hat{\mathbf{g}}_{\lambda_k} := [\mathbf{F}_\lambda(\lambda_k) ]^{-1} \nabla_\lambda h_\lambda(\lambda_k)$`  and the cost function is `$h_\lambda(\lambda) = h_\tau(\tau(\lambda))$`.

Recall that we have the [transformation rule]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-11-02-Geomopt03 %}#parameter-transformation-and-invariance) for natural gradients as
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{\mathbf{g}}_\tau= \mathbf{Q}  \hat{\mathbf{g}}_\lambda 
\end{aligned}
$$` where $Q_{ji}=\frac{\partial \tau^j(\lambda)}{\partial \lambda^i}$.

We can verify that $\mathbf{Q} = \mathbf{U}^{-1}$. Notice that $\tau_0 = \mathbf{U}^{-1} \lambda_0$ by construction.
The update in  `$\eqref{3}$` at iteration $k=1$ then can be re-expressed as
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{1} \leftarrow \tau_{0} -  \alpha  \hat{\mathbf{g}}_{\tau_0} = \mathbf{U}^{-1} \lambda_0 -  \alpha  \mathbf{U}^{-1}  \hat{\mathbf{g}}_{\lambda_0} = \mathbf{U}^{-1} \lambda_1
\end{aligned}
$$`

When `$\alpha$` is small enough, we have  `$\tau_1 \in \Omega_\tau$` and `$\lambda_1 \in \Omega_\lambda$`.
It is easy to show that `$\tau_k = \mathbf{U}^{-1} \lambda_k$` by induction.
Therefore, updates in `$\eqref{3}$` and `$\eqref{4}$` are equivalent.



# Riemannian Gradient Descent and its (Non-linear) Invariance
------
Now we discuss a gradient-based method that is invariant to any intrinsic parameter transformation.

As mentioned before, a manifold in general does not have a vector-space structure. 
We has to **artificially** choose an intrinsic parameterization `$\tau$`, which gives rise to
a parametrization-dependence.
Therefore, it will be ideal if  a 
gradient-based method does not dependent on the choice of intrinsic parametrizations.


We will first introduce the concept of a (one-dimensional) geodesic $\gamma(t)$, which is the "shortest curve" on a manifold with a Riemannian metric (i.e., the Fisher-Rao metric).
Recall that in  [Part II]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-10-04-Geomopt02 %}#riemannian-gradients-as-tangent-vectors-optional) we only define a distance between two Riemannian gradients evaluated at the same point. We can use the length of a geodesic to define the distance between two points on the manifold. 
In statistics, the distance induced by a geodesic with the Fisher-Rao metric is known as the Rao distance {% cite atkinson1981rao %}. This is
known as the boundary value problem (BVP) of a geodesic. The boundary conditions are  specified by  a starting point and an end
point in the manifold. To solve this problem, we often solve an easier problem, which is known as the initial value
problem (IVP) of a geodesic. The initial conditions are  specified by a starting point and an initial Riemannian gradient/velocity.


We will only consider the IVP of a geodesic for simplicity. 
Consider an intrinsic parametrization $\tau$, where $\gamma_\tau(t)$ is the parameter representation of the geodesic.
To specify a geodesic, we need to provide a starting point $\tau_0$ on the manifold and a Riemannian gradient $\mathbf{v}_{\tau_0}$ evluated at point $\tau_0$.
The geodesic is the solution of a system of second-order non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODE) with the following initial conditions.
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\gamma_\tau(0) = \tau_0; \,\,\,\,\,\,
\frac{d \gamma_\tau(t) }{d t} \Big|_{t=0} = \mathbf{v}_{\tau_0}
\end{aligned}
$$` where the geodesic is uniquely determined by the initial conditions and  `$\mathbf{I}_\tau$` is the domain of the parametric geodesic curve. We assume 0 is contained in the domain for simplicity.

For a [geodesically complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic_manifold) manifold, the domain of the geodesic is the whole space  `$\mathbf{I}_{\tau}
=\mathcal{R}$`. We will only consider this case in this post.

To avoid explicitly writing down the differential equations of a geodesic[^1] (i.e., [Christoffel symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levi-Civita_connection#Christoffel_symbols) or [connection 1-form in a section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection_form#Example:_the_Levi-Civita_connection)), 
researchers refer to it as the manifold exponential map.
Given an intrinsic parametrization $\tau$,
the  map at point $\tau_0$  is defined as
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Exp}_{\tau_0}\colon  T_{\tau_0}\mathcal{M} & \mapsto \mathcal{M}\\
\mathbf{v}_{\tau_0} & \mapsto \gamma_\tau(1) \,\,\,\, \textrm{s.t.} \,\,\,\,\,\, \gamma_\tau(0) = \tau_0;\,\,\,\,\,\,
\frac{d \gamma_\tau(t) }{d t} \Big|_{t=0} = \mathbf{v}_{\tau_0}
\end{aligned}
$$`  where `$t$` is fixed to be 1 and `$\tau_0$` denotes the initial point under  parametrization `$\tau$`.

<div class="notice--danger" markdown="1">
**Warning**:

The exponential map is a geometric object.
We use 
a parametric representation of a geodesic curve to define the exponential map.
Thus, the form/expression of the map does depend on the choice of parametrizations.
</div>

Now, we can define a Riemannian gradient method.
Under intrinsic parametrization `$\tau$` of a manifold, (exact) Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) is defined as 
<div class="notice--success" markdown="1">
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{RGD:} &\,\,\,\,\, 
\tau_{k+1} \leftarrow \mathrm{Exp}_{\tau_k} (- \alpha  \hat{\mathbf{g}}_{\tau_k} ) 
\end{aligned}
$$` 
</div>
 where `$\tau_{k+1}$` always stays in the manifold thanks to the exponential map since `$\hat{\mathbf{g}}_{\tau_k}$` is in the domain of the exponential map.


The invariance of this update is due to the uniqueness of the geodesic and the invariance of [the Euler-Lagrange equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solving_the_geodesic_equations). We will not discuss this further in this post to avoid complicated derivations. We will cover this in future posts about calculus of variations.

Although Riemannian gradient descent is nice, the exponential map or the geodesic often has high computational cost and does not admit a closed-form expression.
 

# Many faces of Natural-gradient Descent
------
## Natural-gradient Descent as Inexact Riemannian Gradient Descent

Natural-gradient descent can be derived from a first-order (linear) approximation of the geodesic, which implies that natural-gradient descent is indeed an inexact Riemannian gradient update.
Natural-gradient descent is linearly invariant due to the approximation.

Consider a first-order Taylor approximation at $t=0$ of the geodesic shown below.
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\gamma_\tau(t) \approx  \gamma_\tau(0) + \frac{d  \gamma_\tau(t)}{d t} \Big|_{t=0} (t-0)  
\end{aligned}
$$` 

<div class="notice--danger" markdown="1">
**Warning**:

This approximation does not guarantee that the approximated geodesic stays on the manifold for all $t \neq 0$.
</div>

Recall that the exponential map is defined via the geodesic `$\gamma_\tau(1)$`.
We can use this approximation of the geodesic to define a new map (A.K.A. the Euclidean retraction map) as shown below.
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Ret}_{\tau_0}(\mathbf{v}_{\tau_0}) := \gamma_\tau(0) + \frac{d  \gamma_\tau(t)}{d t} \Big|_{t=0} (1-0) =\tau_0 + \mathbf{v}_{\tau_0}
\end{aligned}
$$` 

Therefore, an inexact Riemannian gradient update with this new map is defined as 
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{k+1} \leftarrow \mathrm{Ret}_{\tau_k} (- \alpha  \hat{\mathbf{g}}_{\tau_k} )  = \tau_k  - \alpha  \hat{\mathbf{g}}_{\tau_k}
\end{aligned}
$$` which recovers natural-gradient descent.

 
## Natural-gradient Descent as Unconstrained Proximal-gradient Descent

In this section, we will make an additional  assumption:

<div class="notice--success" markdown="1">
**Additional assumption**:

The parameter space `$\Omega_\tau=\mathcal{R}^K$` is unconstrained.
</div>


As we mentioned before, the **distances** in the gradient space and the parameter space are defined differently. 
In the [previous section](#riemannian-gradient-descent-and-its-non-linear-invariance), we use the geodesic to define the distance between two points in a parameter space.


We could also use other "distances" denoted by `$\mathrm{D}(.,.)$` (i.e., Kullback–Leibler divergence) {% cite khan2016faster %} to define the length between two points in a parameter space.


In the following section, we assume `$p(w|\mathbf{y})$` and `$p(w|\tau_k)$` are two members  in a parameteric distribution family `$p(w|\tau)$` indexed by  `$\mathbf{y}$` and `$\tau_k$`, respectively.

We define a class of f-divergence in this case. 
Note that a f-divergence can be defined in a more general setting.

### Csiszar f-divergence
------

Let `$f:(0,+\infty)\mapsto \mathcal{R}$` be a  smooth scalar function satisfying all the following conditions.
* convex in its domain
* `$f(1)=0$`
* `$\ddot{f}(1)=1$`

A f-divergence for a parametric family `$p(w|\tau)$` is defined as
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{D}_f(\mathbf{y},\tau_k) := \int f(\frac{p(w|\mathbf{y})}{p(w|\tau_k)}) p(w|\tau_k) dw.
\end{aligned}
$$`
Thanks to Jensen's inequality,
a f-divergence is always non-negative as  
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{D}_f(\mathbf{y},\tau_k) \geq  f( \int \frac{p(w|\mathbf{y})}{p(w|\tau_k)} p(w|\tau_k) dw )  = f(\int p(w|\mathbf{y})dw) =f(1) =0 .
\end{aligned}
$$`

The KL divergence is a f-divergence where $f(t)=-\log(t)$.

### Proximal-gradient descent
------
Given such a "distance" `$\mathrm{D}(\mathbf{y},\tau_k)$`, we could perform an unconstrained proximal-gradient update as
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{k+1} \leftarrow \arg\min_{\mathbf{y} \in  \mathcal{R}^K  } \{ \langle \mathbf{g}_{\tau_k}, \mathbf{y}\rangle   + \frac{1}{\alpha} \mathrm{D}(\mathbf{y},\tau_k) \}
\end{aligned}
$$` where `$\mathbf{g}_{\tau_k}$` is a Eulcidean gradient and the parameter space `$\Omega_\tau$` is unconstrained. 


<div class="notice--success" markdown="1">
**Claim**: 

The secord-order Taylor approximation of any f-divergence `$\mathrm{D}_f(\mathbf{y},\tau_k)$` at `$\mathbf{y}=\tau_k$` is  `$\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{y}-\tau_k)^T \mathbf{F}_\tau(\tau_k) (\mathbf{y}-\tau_k)$` 
</div>

<div class="notice--info" markdown="1">
<details>
<summary>Proof of the claim: (click to expand)</summary>
<fieldset class="field-set" markdown="1">
Proof:

We will show that the second-order Talor approximation denoted by `$\mathrm{D}(\mathbf{y},\tau_k)$`  can be expressed as below.
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{D}(\mathbf{y},\tau_k) := \underbrace{\mathrm{D}_f(\tau_k,\tau_k)}_{=0} + (\mathbf{y}-\tau_k)^T \underbrace{ [\nabla_y  \mathrm{D}_f(\mathbf{y},\tau_k) \big|_{y=\tau_k}]}_{=0} +\frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{y}-\tau_k)^T \underbrace{ [\nabla_y^2  \mathrm{D}_f(\mathbf{y},\tau_k)\big|_{y=\tau_k}]}_{ =\mathbf{F}_\tau(\tau_k) } (\mathbf{y}-\tau_k)
\end{aligned}
$$`

For the zero-order term, we have
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{D}_f(\tau_k,\tau_k) & = \int f(\frac{p(w|{\tau_k})}{p(w|\tau_k)}) p(w|\tau_k) dw 
= \int \underbrace{f(1)}_{=0} p(w|\tau_k) dw =0.
\end{aligned}
$$`

For the first-order term, we have
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla_y \mathrm{D}_f(\mathbf{y},\tau_k) &  =
\int \nabla_y f(\frac{p(w|\mathbf{y})}{p(w|\tau_k)}) p(w|\tau_k) dw \\
&=\int  \dot{f}\big(\frac{p(w|\mathbf{y})}{p(w|\tau_k)}\big) \frac{\nabla_y p(w|\mathbf{y})}{p(w|\tau_k)} p(w|\tau_k) dw \\
&=\int  \dot{f}\big(\frac{p(w|\mathbf{y})}{p(w|\tau_k)}\big) \nabla_y p(w|\mathbf{y}) dw.
\end{aligned}
$$`

Note that when $y=\tau_k$, we can simplify the expression since 
`$\dot{f}\big(\frac{p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)}\big)=\dot{f}(1)$` is a constant.
Therefore,
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla_y \mathrm{D}_f(\mathbf{y},\tau_k) \big|_{y=\tau_k}  
=\int  \dot{f}(1) \nabla_y p(w|\mathbf{y}) \big|_{y=\tau_k} dw =  
\dot{f}(1)  \nabla_y \underbrace{\Big[ \int   p(w|\mathbf{y}) dw \Big]}_{=1} \Big|_{y=\tau_k} = 0.
\end{aligned}
$$`


For the second-order term, we have
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla_{y}^2 \mathrm{D}_f(y,\tau_k) & = 
\int \nabla_{y}^2 f\big(\frac{p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)}\big) p(w|\tau_k) dw  \\
&= \int \nabla_{y} [\dot{f}\big(\frac{p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)}\big) \frac{\nabla_y p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)} ] p(w|\tau_k) dw \\
&= \int \Big[\ddot{f}\big(\frac{p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)}\big) \frac{\nabla_y p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)} \frac{\nabla_y^T p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)}+\dot{f}\big(\frac{p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)}\big) \frac{\nabla_y^2 p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)} \Big] p(w|\tau_k) dw 
\end{aligned}
$$`
Note that when $y=\tau_k$, we can simplify the expression since `$\ddot{f}\big(\frac{p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)}\big)=\ddot{f}(1)=1$` and 
`$\dot{f}\big(\frac{p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)}\big)=\dot{f}(1)$` is a constant. 

Therefore,
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\nabla_{y}^2 \mathrm{D}_f(y,\tau_k) \Big|_{y=\tau_k} 
&= \int \Big[\ddot{f}\big(\frac{p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)}\big) \frac{\nabla_y p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)} \frac{\nabla_y^T p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)} +\dot{f}\big(\frac{p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)}\big) \frac{\nabla_y^2 p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)} \Big] p(w|\tau_k) dw \Big|_{y=\tau_k} \\
&=\underbrace{\int  \frac{\nabla_y p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)} \frac{\nabla_y^T p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)} p(w|\tau_k) dw  \Big|_{y=\tau_k}}_{\text{Term I}} + \underbrace{\int \dot{f}(1) \frac{\nabla_y^2 p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)}  p(w|\tau_k) dw  \Big|_{y=\tau_k}}_{\text{Term II}}
\end{aligned}
$$`

Term II is zero since
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\int \dot{f}(1) \frac{\nabla_y^2 p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)}  p(w|\tau_k) dw \Big|_{y=\tau_k}= \dot{f}(1) \int  \nabla_y^2 p(w|y) dw \Big|_{y=\tau_k}= \dot{f}(1) \nabla_y^2 \underbrace{\Big[\int   p(w|y) dw \Big] }_{=1} \Big|_{y=\tau_k}=0
\end{aligned}
$$`

Term I is the FIM since
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\int  \underbrace{ \frac{\nabla_y p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)}}_{= \nabla_y \log p(w|y)}  \frac{\nabla_y^T p(w|y)}{p(w|\tau_k)} p(w|\tau_k) dw  \Big|_{y=\tau_k} &=
E_{p(w|\tau_k)} \Big[ \nabla_y \log p(w|y)   \nabla_y^T \log p(w|y) \Big] \Big|_{y=\tau_k} \\
&=
E_{p(w|\tau_k)} \Big[ \nabla_\tau \log p(w|\tau_k)   \nabla_\tau^T \log p(w|\tau_k) \Big] \\
&= \mathbf{F}_\tau(\tau_k)
\end{aligned}
$$`

By the claim, when `$\mathrm{D}(\mathbf{y},\tau_k)$` is the second-order Taylor approximation of a
f-divergence `$\mathrm{D}_f(\mathbf{y},\tau_k)$`  at `$\mathbf{y}=\tau_k$`,
the unconstrained proximal-gradient update can be re-expressed as
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{k+1} \leftarrow \arg\min_{y \in  \mathcal{R}^K  } \{ \langle \mathbf{g}_{\tau_k}, \mathbf{y} \rangle   + \frac{1}{2\alpha} (\mathbf{y}-\tau_k)^T \mathbf{F}_\tau(\tau_k) (\mathbf{y}-\tau_k) \}
\end{aligned}
$$` 

It is easy to see that we can obtain the following natural-gradient update from the above expression.
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{k+1} \leftarrow \tau_{k} - \alpha \underbrace{ \mathbf{F}^{-1}_\tau(\tau_k) \mathbf{g}_{\tau_k}}_{ =\hat{\mathbf{g}}_{\tau_k} }
\end{aligned}
$$`

In [Part V]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-12-14-Geomopt05%}#natural-gradient-descent-as-unconstrained-mirror-descent)   , we will show that  `$\mathrm{D}(y,\tau_k)$` can also be an exact KL divergence when $p(w)$ is an exponential family.
Under a particular parametrization,  natural-gradient descent also can be viewed as (unconstrained) mirror descent.



<div class="notice--danger" markdown="1">
**Warning**:

The connection bewteen natural-gradient descent and proximal-gradient/mirror descent could break down in constrained cases unless `$\alpha$` is small enough. We will cover more about this point in [Part VI]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-12-22-Geomopt06 %}).

# Natural-gradient Descent in Non-intrinsic Parameter Spaces
------
As mentioned in [Part I]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-09-06-Geomopt01 %}#intrinsic-parameterizations), an intrinsic parametrization creates a nice parameter space (e.g., a local vector space structure) and guarantees a non-singular FIM.
We now discuss issues when it comes to  natural-gradient descent over non-intrinsic parametrizations including overparameterization. 

1. We may not have a local vector space structure in a non-intrinsic parameter space. Therefore, natural-gradient descent in this parameter space is pointless since the updated parameter will leave the parameter space. Indeed, the FIM could also be ill-defined in such cases. We will illustrate this by examples.

2. The FIM is singular in a non-intrinsic space. In theory, Moore–Penrose inverse could be used to compute natural-gradients so that natural-gradient descent is linearly invariant in this case. However, Moore–Penrose inverse often has to use the [singular value decomposition]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) (SVD) and  destroies structures of the FIM.  In practice, the iteration cost of Moore–Penrose inverse is very high as illustrated in the following example.

3. It is tempting to approximate the singular FIM by an emprical FIM with a scalar damping term and use Woodbury matrix identity to reduce the iteration cost of computing natural-gradients. However, sample-based emprical approximations could be problematic {% cite  kunstner2019limitations %}.
Moreover, damping introduces an additional tuning hyper-parameter and destories the linear invariance property of  natural-gradient descent. Such an approximation should be used with caution.
 


# Euclidean Gradient Descent is NOT (Linearly) Invariant
------
For simplicity, consider an unconstrained optimization problem.
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\tau \in \mathcal{R}^K } h_\tau(\tau)
\end{aligned}
$$` 

Euclidean gradient descent (GD) in parametrization `$\tau$` is
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{k+1} \leftarrow \tau_{k} - \alpha {\mathbf{g}}_{\tau_k} 
\end{aligned}\tag{5}\label{5}
$$` where `${\mathbf{g}}_{\tau_k} := \nabla_\tau h_\tau(\tau_k)$` is a Euclidean gradient.



Consider a reparametrization  `$\lambda$` so that `$\lambda=\mathbf{U} \tau$`, where `$\mathbf{U}$` is a constant (square) invertible matrix. 
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\lambda \in \mathcal{R}^K } h_\lambda(\lambda):= h_\tau( \mathbf{U}^{-1} \lambda)
\end{aligned}
$$` 

The Euclidean gradient descent (GD) in parametrization `$\lambda$` is
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\lambda_{k+1} \leftarrow \lambda_{k} - \alpha {\mathbf{g}}_{\lambda_k} 
\end{aligned}\tag{6}\label{6}
$$` where `${\mathbf{g}}_{\lambda_k} := \nabla_\lambda h_\lambda(\lambda_k)$` is a Euclidean gradient.


Note that Euclidean gradients follow the [transformation rule]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-11-02-Geomopt03 %}#parameter-transformation-and-invariance)  as

`$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{g}_\tau^T =  \mathbf{g}_\lambda^T \mathbf{J}
\end{aligned}
$$` where  `$J_{ki}:=\frac{\partial \lambda^k(\tau) }{ \partial \tau^i }$`

We can verify that `$\mathbf{J}=\mathbf{U}$` and `$\mathbf{g}_\tau = \mathbf{U}^T \mathbf{g}_\lambda $`.

Notice that `$\tau_0 = \mathbf{U}^{-1} \lambda_0$` by construction.
The update in  `$\eqref{5}$` at iteration $k=1$ then can be re-expressed as
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{1} \leftarrow \tau_{0} -  \alpha  {\mathbf{g}}_{\tau_0} = \mathbf{U}^{-1} \lambda_0 -  \alpha  \mathbf{U}^{T}  {\mathbf{g}}_{\lambda_0} \neq \mathbf{U}^{-1} \lambda_1
\end{aligned}
$$`

It is easy to see that
updates in `$\eqref{5}$` and `$\eqref{6}$` are NOT equivalent.
Therefore,  Euclidean gradient descent is not invariant.




# Newton's Method is Linearly Invariant
------
For simplicity, consider an unconstrained convex optimization problem.
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\tau \in \mathcal{R}^K } h_\tau(\tau)
\end{aligned}
$$` where `$h_\tau(\tau)$` is strongly convex and twice continuously differentiable w.r.t. `$\tau$`.

Newton's method under parametrization `$\tau$` is
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\tau_{k+1} \leftarrow \tau_{k} - \alpha \mathbf{H}^{-1}_\tau(\tau_k) {\mathbf{g}}_{\tau_k} 
\end{aligned}
$$` where `${\mathbf{g}}_{\tau_k} := \nabla_\tau h_\tau(\tau_k)$` is a Euclidean gradient and `$\mathbf{H}_\tau(\tau_k):=\nabla_\tau^2 h_\tau(\tau_k)$` is the Hessian.



Consider a reparametrization  `$\lambda$` so that `$\lambda=\mathbf{U} \tau$`, where `$\mathbf{U}$` is a constant (square) invertible matrix. 
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\min_{\lambda \in \mathcal{R}^K } h_\lambda(\lambda):= h_\tau( \mathbf{U}^{-1} \lambda)
\end{aligned}
$$` where `$h_\lambda(\lambda)$` is also strongly convex w.r.t. `$\lambda$` due to  `$\eqref{7}$`.

Newton's method under parametrization `$\lambda$` is
`$$
\begin{aligned}
\lambda_{k+1} \leftarrow \lambda_{k} - \alpha \mathbf{H}^{-1}_\lambda(\lambda_k) {\mathbf{g}}_{\lambda_k} 
\end{aligned} 
$$` where `${\mathbf{g}}_{\lambda_k} := \nabla_\lambda h_\lambda(\lambda_k)$` is a Euclidean gradient and
`$\mathbf{H}_\tau(\lambda_k):=\nabla_\lambda^2 h_\lambda(\lambda_k)$` is the Hessian.

As we discussed in the previous section, 
Euclidean gradients follow the
[transformation rule]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-11-02-Geomopt03 %}#parameter-transformation-and-invariance) as `$\mathbf{g}_\tau^T =  \mathbf{g}_\lambda^T \mathbf{J}$`, where
`$\mathbf{J}=\mathbf{U}$`.

Surprisingly, for a linear transformation, the Hessian follows the [transformation rule]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-11-02-Geomopt03 %}#transformation-rule-for-the-fisher-information-matrix)  like the FIM as

`$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{H}_{\tau} (\tau_k) &= \nabla_\tau ( \mathbf{g}_{\tau_k} ) \\
&=\nabla_\tau ( \mathbf{J}^T \mathbf{g}_{\lambda_k} ) \\
&=\mathbf{J}^T\nabla_\tau (  \mathbf{g}_{\lambda_k} ) + \underbrace{[\nabla_\tau \mathbf{J}^T ]}_{=0} \mathbf{g}_{\lambda_k}  \,\,\,\,\text{(In linear cases, } \mathbf{J} = \mathbf{U}\text{ is a constant)}   \\
&=\mathbf{J}^T [ \nabla_\lambda (  \mathbf{g}_{\lambda_k} ) ] \mathbf{J} \\ 
&=\mathbf{J}^T \mathbf{H}_{\lambda} (\lambda_k)\mathbf{J} 
\end{aligned}\tag{7}\label{7}
$$`




Therefore, the direction in Newton's method denoted by `$\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_{\tau_k} := \mathbf{H}^{-1}_\tau(\tau_k) \mathbf{g}_{\tau_k}$` is transformed like natural-gradients in **linear** cases as

`$$
\begin{aligned}
\tilde{\mathbf{g}}_{\tau_k} &:= \mathbf{H}^{-1}_\tau(\tau_k) \mathbf{g}_{\tau_k} \\
&= [ \mathbf{J}^T \mathbf{H}_{\lambda} (\lambda_k)\mathbf{J} ]^{-1} \mathbf{g}_{\tau_k} \\
&=  \mathbf{J}^{-1} \mathbf{H}^{-1}_{\lambda} (\lambda_k)\mathbf{J}^{-T} [ \mathbf{J}^{T}\mathbf{g}_{\lambda_k} ] \\
&=  \mathbf{J}^{-1} \mathbf{H}^{-1}_{\lambda} (\lambda_k) \mathbf{g}_{\lambda_k}  \\
&=  \mathbf{J}^{-1}  \tilde{\mathbf{g}}_{\lambda_k}  \\
&=  \mathbf{Q}  \tilde{\mathbf{g}}_{\lambda_k}  \\
\end{aligned} 
$$` where by the definition we have `$\mathbf{Q}= \mathbf{J}^{-1}$`.


The consequence is that Newton's method like natural-gradient descent is linearly invariant.


## The Hessian is not a valid manifold metric

The Hessian `$\mathbf{H}_\tau(\tau_k)=\nabla_\tau^2 h_\tau(\tau_k)$`  in general is not a valid manifold metric since it does not follow the transformation
rule of a metric in non-linear cases[^2].



Contrastingly, the FIM is a valid manifold metric. Recall that the FIM can also be computed
as
`$\mathbf{F}_\tau(\tau) = E_{p(w|\tau)}\big[ -\nabla_\tau^2 \log p(w|\tau) \big]$`.

We will discuss in
[Part V]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-12-14-Geomopt05 %}#minimal-parametrizations-of-exponential-family), for a special parametrization `$\tau$` (known as a natural parametrization) of [exponential family]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2021-12-14-Geomopt05 %}#exponential-family), the FIM under this parametrization can be computed  as
`$\mathbf{F}_\tau(\tau) = \nabla_\tau^2 A_\tau(\tau)$`, where `$A_\tau(\tau)$` is a strictly convex function.

In the literature, the exponential family with a natural parametrization is known as a Hessian manifold {% cite shima2007geometry %}, where the FIM
under this kind of parametrization is called a Hessian metric.
However, a non-linear reparametrization will lead to a non-natural parametrization.
