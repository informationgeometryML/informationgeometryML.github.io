In this series of blog posts, I will cover the basics of information geometry with a focus on optimization. 

There will be 4 blog posts to cover this basic.
* The first post is about motivation and statistical manifolds.
* The second post is about the Fisher-Rao metric and Riemannian/natural gradients.
* The third post is about natural-gradient descent (NGD) and Riemannian-gradient descent.
* The last post is about natural-gradient descent and mirror descent for exponential family distributions.
