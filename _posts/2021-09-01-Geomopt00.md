In this series of blog posts, we will cover an application of information geometry in machine learning with a focus on optimization. 

There will be 4 blog posts to cover this basic.
* The first post is about motivation and the Fisher-Rao metric.
* The second post is about Riemannian/natural gradients.
* The third post is about natural-gradient descent (NGD) and Riemannian-gradient descent.
* The last post is about natural-gradient descent and mirror descent for exponential family distributions.
